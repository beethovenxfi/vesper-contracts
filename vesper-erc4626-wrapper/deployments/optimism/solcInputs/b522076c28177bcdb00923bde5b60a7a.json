Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.
